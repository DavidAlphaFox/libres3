1.1.1 (15-Feb-2014):
* Improve portability on *BSD by not including `malloc.h` and
  just using `stdlib.h` instead.

1.1.0 (30-Jan-2014):
* Do not depend directly on the mirage-types signature to help
  break a circular dependency.  The `portable` test still exists
  to check against when changing anything.

1.0.0 (16-Jan-2014):
* Refactor the library into one pure-OCaml library (`io-page`)
  library and the Unix C-bindings (`io-page.unix`).

0.9.9 (07-Dec-2013):
* Add Travis CI scripts.
* Switch to an OASIS build system to fix META and C bindings.

0.1.0 (02-Dec-2013):
* Initial public release, based on mirage/mirage-platform#0.9.8
