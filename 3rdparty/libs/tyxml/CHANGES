===== dev ====

===== 3.3.0 ====

  * Add `Xml_print.Utf8` to encode html elements to utf8 properly.

===== 3.2.1 ====

  * Add signature functors to ease export of module created with the functorial interface.
    See the manual for more details.
  * Fix variance for Svg.attrib.
  * Fix export of Xml.list_wrap for Html5.M and Svg.M. Should fix syntax extension with those.

===== 3.2.0 ====

  * Remove Xhtml.
  * Remove plus elements.
    For example, table doesn't enforce non-emptyness anymore.
  * Add various types that were not exported (img, dl, figure, rp, rt and ruby types).
  * Expose `string_of_number`, the better stringifier introduced in 3.1.0.

  * Functorial interface breaking changes:
    * Modify the functorized interface to export typed events.
      You can now specify different handlers for keyboard and mouse events.
      There are two new types and functions (keyboard and mous events) in the Xml signature.
    * Add a wrapping type for lists of nodes. See reactiveData and new eliom wrapping.

===== 3.1.0 ====

  * Replace fake booleans (`\`True | \`False`) by actual booleans. Breaking change.
  * Camlp4 is now an optional dependency. The syntax extension is build only when the syntax flag is enabled (true by default).
  * Use a better stringifier for float values (copied from js_of_ocaml).
  * Add attributes `muted`, `crossorigin` and `mediagroup` for `<audio>` and `<video>`.
  * Various misc fixes
    * Fix in the svg syntax extension
    * Typo "proress" -> "progress"

===== 3.0.0 ====

  * In the functorial interface, allow to wrap xml nodes inside a monad by providing an additionnal wrapping module. Used by reactive nodes in eliom.
  * Use oasis as build systems
  * Various bug fixes, mostly related to the svg module.

===== 2.3.0 =====

  * Adding module Unsafe for inserting missing nodes or attributes

===== 2.2.0 =====

  * Adding tag <u>

===== 2.1.0 =====

 * Explicit choice of implementation for syntax extension

===== 2.0.2 =====

 * Add a simple printer: XML.print
 * API change:
 ** Rename XML.event into XML.event_handler
 ** The functorized interface now export the concrete representation of XML.nodes
 ** Open types in SVG_sigs (closes #269).

===== 2.0.1 =====

 * Allow compilation on win32/msvc
 * Truly allow to abstract the XMl.uri representation
 * Always print XHTML in a format that is "Html compatible":
 ** Add missing namespace in <html>.

 * Allow the namespace attribute in HTML5 elements.
 * Always print polyglot XML. ( document correct as HTML5 and as XML )

===== 2.0-rc1 =====

 * Some fixes to match the latest HTML5 working draft (05/08/2011).
 * Simplification of the functorial interface (use module substitution)
 * Fix IFrame usage.

===== 1.91 =====

 * First independant release (was released with ocsigen)
 * Add a functorial interface for concrete XML representation
 * Add a functorial interface for stream printer
 * Rename XHTML5 into HTML5
