\section{libres3\_report}

If you face a problem connecting to your LibreS3 server, please run
\verb|libres3_report| which generates a file \path{libres3-report-*.log} in the
current directory, containing details about LibreS3's build and runtime
configuration, and logs.

By default the secret key is removed from the output, but names and IP addresses
are not anonymized to make debugging easier.
You can anonymize the logged information by running
 \verb|libres3_report --anonymize| which replaces each name and IP address with
 a hash.

\section{Logs}

You can read the logs directly at \path{/var/log/libres3/*.log}.

To enable logging of full HTTP requests run the following commands:

\begin{lstlisting}
# export LIBRES3_DEBUG=1
# libres3 restart
\end{lstlisting}

To enable debugging of the LibreS3 and \SX communication:
\begin{lstlisting}
# libres3 stop
# libres3_ocsigen --foreground --debug
\end{lstlisting}
